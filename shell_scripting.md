# Writing shell scripts
Programming can be done one line at a time in the command prompt, or by scripting, where the code is all written beforehand and then run later. Each has its place, but scripting tends to be more useful than running a single line at a time. Scripting can be done in many languages, (for example, Perl and Python are commonly used for scripting in bioinformatics) but since many bioinformatics tools are run from the command line, I find shell scripting simpler than wrapping the tools into Python. This tutorial shows some of the utility and features of shell scripting by walking through a common first program â€“ 'Hello World'

## Setting up your script
In your shell type `nano hello_world.sh`. The window will change from the regular shell to a text editor. The bar across the top has the `nano` version and the name of your file: `hello_world.sh`
On the first line of your file, type `#!/usr/bin/bash`. The `#!` symbol (called a 'shebang') tells the shell to send the contents of the file to the program after it. You can find the location of a program with the `which <program>` command. 

## Writing the body of your script
'Hello World' is a simple program that simply prints `Hello World` to the console. The version I'm using here does a few extra things to illustrate some of the more interesting features of shell scripting. 
### Hello World and a brief discussion of documentation
The `echo` command prints the rest of the line to the console, so the basic Hello World program in Unix would look like:
`#!/usr/bin/bash
echo Hello World` #prints 'Hello World' to the console
As you can see this is a pretty boring script and it may not seem like there's any reason to even try it. However, I use `echo` quite frequently in my scripts, because it can tell me what step the computer is on. This can be helpful for debugging, or just to see the progress of the script. Another important feature of the simple Hello World script is the comment, denoted by '#'. Comments help make your code more readable to your future self and anyone else who's looking at it. When in doubt, add a comment. You'll thank yourself later.

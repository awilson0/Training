# Navigating the UNIX command line
This is a brief introduction to the UNIX command line and several commands that I use more than anything else. I'm not sure which of these commands work in the Windows command prompt so I recommend exploring the UNIX command line using a bash shell on a MacOS or Linux distro.

## Common commands
This is an inexhaustive list of the commands that I use most often/find the most helpful.
* `ls` - list all of the files and directories in your working directory
* `pwd` - prints your working directory to the shell if you get lost in your filesystem
* `cd` - changes the working directory
* `man` - opens documentation for a different command (ex `man ls` gives help information for the `ls` command)
* `head`/`tail` - shows the first/last lines of a file
* `less` - shows contents of a file in the shell
* `cp`/`mv <file1> <file2>` - copy/move the contents of file 1 to file 2

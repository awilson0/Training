# Navigating the UNIX command line
This is a brief introduction to the UNIX command line and several commands that I use more than anything else. I'm not sure which of these commands work in the Windows command prompt so I recommend exploring the UNIX command line using a bash shell on a MacOS or Linux distro.

## What is the UNIX shell?
The UNIX shell is a command line interpreter. You can use text-based commands in the UNIX shell to write files, run software, learn what your computer is currently running, and find files that are hidden somewhere on your computer.

## Common commands
This is an inexhaustive list of the commands that I use most often/find the most helpful.
* `ls` - list all of the files and directories in your working directory
* `pwd` - prints your working directory to the shell if you get lost in your filesystem
* `cd` - changes the working directory
* `man` - opens documentation for a different command (ex `man ls` gives help information for the `ls` command)
* `head`/`tail` - shows the first/last lines of a file
* `less` - shows contents of a file in the shell
* `cp`/`mv <file1> <file2>` - copy/move the contents of file 1 to file 2

## Troubleshooting/External resources
Most (if not all) of the coding that you'll do at the beginning is stuff that many people have done before you. It is very unlikely that you will get errors that nobody else has gotten before. There are plenty of good resources out there for troubleshooting code. Here is my general troubleshooting process:
1. Check [StackExchange](https://www.stackexchange.com). StackExchange is a wonderful resource full of experienced programmers and most general questions (including some about common software) 
2. Google the error message 
3. Ask a question on StackExchange or raise an issue on Github

I will post links to good external resources for learning UNIX commands in this space in the future.

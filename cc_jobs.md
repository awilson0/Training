# Running a job on Compute Canada servers
Logging in to Compute Canada with `ssh username@server.computecanada.ca`, where username and server are specific to you and your preferred server, opens a login node. Imagine a login node is like your PC, you can run a few small jobs on it, but things that need more memory will crash. Larger jobs need to be submitted through SLURM, which is the scheduling program used on Compute Canada servers.

# Training
This series of short tutorials are designed to help teach basic computing skills like navigating the UNIX command line, writing shell scripts and running jobs on ComputeCanada servers.

## Navigating the UNIX command line
There are many online tools that can do a much better job of teaching this content than I can, so this short tutorial is not meant to be an exhaustive resource. I will probably add to it in the future, but for right now it will just be a short introduction with a few links to particularly helpful external resources.

## Writing shell scripts
This tutorial provides a quick overview of shell scripts and unique UNIX commands that aren't commonly used in the shell.

## Running jobs on a ComputeCanada server
There is pretty good documentation for submitting jobs on the ComputeCanada [wiki](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Running_jobs), but this tutorial aims to provide a more concise summary of the information needed to run a simple job using the SLURM task manager.
